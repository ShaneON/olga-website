    <p local-class="text"> I’m an experienced English teacher, who has engaged in all aspects
        of teaching from developing English courses to helping people to apply their knowledge
        in real life. I have a strong background in the education industry and linguistic study
         which I got at the
         <a local-class="link" href="https://lunn.ru/en"> Nizhny Novgorod Linguistic University. </a>

         Along with teaching, my other passion is translating. In my opinion, both of them are
         professions that require a certain level of creativity and that’s a big part of me.
