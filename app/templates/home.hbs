      <p local-class="text"> Olga is an experienced English teacher, who has engaged in all aspects
          of teaching from developing English courses to helping people to apply their knowledge
          in real life. I have a strong background in the education industry and linguistic study
           which I got at the
           <a local-class="link" href="https://lunn.ru/en"> Nizhny Novgorod Linguistic University. </a>
           Along with teaching, my other passion is translating. In my opinion, both of them are
           professions that require a certain level of creativity and thatâ€™s a big part of me.
